				<h1>The blockquote element</h1>
					<p>Here is a quote from Haruki Murakami:</p>
						<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/990804-wherever-there-s-hope-there-s-a-trial-you-re-exactly-right-absolutely"> 
						“Wherever there's hope there's a trial.
						You're exactly right. Absolutely.
						Hope, however, is limited, and generally abstract, while
						there are countless trials, and they tend to be concrete.
						That is also something I had to learn on my own.”
